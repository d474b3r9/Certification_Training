# Data engineer path

- What i learnt ?

## Data science

- Andrew NG course is a very good start for understanding data science concepts.

## Hadoop

- This udemy course is a good practice to get handes on cloudera/hortonwork.

## GCP data engineering

- I roughly recommends two courses :
- First coursera for overview and quicklabs.
- Thus this course is also very good as you have quicklabs embeddeb.

- The secound course is an execellent begining for training and test your knowledge:
- The final quiz is near that what you can expect during the certification exam. But it is also much more easier ;).

## The final rush before the exam

- Find quiz on the internet and train, review, train, review... to find out your local minimum :D.

## The 29 march the exam will be updated

- I warn you because you have more topic to expect.
- It is useless to review the 2 case studies as they will no longer exists.
- The new topics are : Cloud memstore (managed google redis), cloud flow composer (managed airflow), you also need to review Laws and rights for Data compliance rgdp ...

Thank you coursera, linux academy and udemy for those great materials !
